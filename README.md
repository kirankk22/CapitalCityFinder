Write a dynamic xpath that would return the capital city corresponding to a country.

For example, if I write 'Afghanistan' in the xpath, the xpath should return 'Kabul';
if I write 'Albania', it must return 'Tirana' and so on. 

Use the following website URL :
https://www.countries-ofthe-world.com/capitals-of-the-world.html
